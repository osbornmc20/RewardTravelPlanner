The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is undoubtedly the amazing rooftop pool, offering panoramic views of the azure Sea of Cortez. It's a perfect vantage point for both sunrise enthusiasts and sunset romantics. \n\nAdditionally, guests have exclusive access to El Ganzo's own swimmable beach \u2013 a rarity in this region known for its rough waters. The privacy afforded by its location, not being flanked by other resorts, adds to the sense of exclusive tranquility.\n\nEvery room at Hotel El Ganzo boasts an oceanfront view, ensuring that guests can wake up to the sight and sounds of waves gently kissing the shore.

You can't go wrong with any of them, but the simple menu of seafood & tacos at the Beach Club is a highlight for us.\n\n**The Ganzo De Playa**: Enjoy your meal with sand between your toes and the sound of waves in the background. Fresh Ceviches, yummy tacos, and incredible views await.\n\n**The Rooftop**: The rooftop restaurant offers a variety of options from seafood to burgers while soaking up panoramic views of the Sea of Cortez.\n\n**El Restaurante**: This is the main restaurant, off the lobby, where they serve breakfast, lunch, and a more formal dinner. We love the breakfast options, especially the weekend buffet, but are not always a fan of the dinner menu. I've felt that the ingredient combinations are a bit strange and we generally avoid eating here at night. *Pro Tip - Go the the restaurant at La Marina Inn across the street for an amazing dinner with live music!*\n\n**Taco Taco Ganzo**: This taco truck is a new addition that was added to the property within the last year or two. Open late on weekends, it offers guests and locals a chance for an authentic Mexican street taco without leaving the property.\n\n### Activities\n- Enjoy fresh seafood at the beachfront restaurant\n- Sample creative cocktails at the rooftop bar\n- Experience authentic Mexican street tacos at Taco Taco Ganzo\n- Take a short walk to nearby La Marina Inn for dinner alternatives\n\n\n\n## The Artistic Atmosphere\n\nThis isn't your standard beach resort; it's a living, breathing gallery.

You can wander through the corridors and stumble upon a groundbreaking piece of contemporary art, making your stay not only relaxing but culturally enriching.\n\nThe Underground Recording Studio: Yes, you read that right! Hotel El Ganzo houses an underground recording studio where musicians from around the globe have recorded. Who knows? You might share an elevator with a Grammy award-winning artist.\n\nThe Ganzo Downstairs: This isn't just another hotel bar, it's a destination in itself. With live music performances and an impressive cocktail menu that changes with the seasons, The Ganzo Downstairs is the perfect spot to let your hair down and dance the night away.\n\n### Activities\n- Tour the hotel's art collection with staff guides\n- Check the schedule for live music performances\n- Visit the underground recording studio (when available)\n- Attend special art events and music showcases\n\n\n\n## Things That Could Improve\n\nWhile Hotel El Ganzo offers an exceptional experience, there are a few areas where improvements could be made:\n\n1. **Consistent Customer Service**: While most of the staff provide excellent service, there can be occasional inconsistencies in the level of attention and care provided.\n\n2. **Dinner Menu Variety**: Though the food quality is excellent, the dinner menu at El Restaurante could benefit from more diverse options and flavors that appeal to a wider range of palates.\n\n3. **Location**: The hotel's secluded location is part of its charm, but it does mean there aren't many attractions within walking distance. Guests should plan to rent a car or use taxis for exploring beyond the property.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith everything considered \u2013 from its stunning location and impressive amenities to its few shortcomings \u2013 Hotel El Ganzo deserves an 8 out of 10 rating. It stands as a beacon for those seeking luxury without ostentation and offers a unique blend of artistry, relaxation, and personal service. \n\nFor travelers looking for an upscale retreat with character and charm away from crowded tourist spots, Hotel El Ganzo will not disappoint.
